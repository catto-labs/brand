# brand
A repository cointaining catto labs' branding assets, for use in all sorts of scenarios.

The catto labs brand belongs to us, Trobonox, Pixel, and Vexcited. the entity that guides and supports development of catto labs. These guidelines describe when and how the brand should be used. 

## A few things to keep in mind...
catto labs claims two marks: the "catto labs" logo-type, and the "Pokaimon" logo-mark. 

Both should be used with the following in mind:
* Do not stretch, skew, rotate, flip, or otherwise alter the marks.
* It is recommended to use the marks on a solid colour or gradient, but busy backgrounds may work too - experiment and see which one fits.
* The marks should NOT have the colours altered, if it does not fit your styling, please use our monochrome marks. 

## Logo variant usage and description
### Brand Marks or Types
These logos work best on simple, monochrome backgrounds (e.g. white logo on a dark background, and vice versa), and colour backgrounds, too.

If you have a wider area, consider using our logo-type instead.

### Logo-type
This is a variant where our type is placed next to our logo, hence the name - logo-type.

Use these if you have a wider area to place our logo in (e.g. the footer of a website, or a carousel of other companies)

Like the brand marks, you should only use these on simple, monochrome or colour backgrounds.

### Badges
The catto labs branding files also come with two types of badges, one with our logo, in circle or square, and one with our logo-type, in various colourways.

If you're unsure about using the other two, this one is the best for you - it works with any background and also works well on simple backgrounds, too.

You're allowed to use these anywhere, sized small, or big (e.g. in a GitHub readme, or on the footer of a website)

## Questions, anyone?
